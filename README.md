Pramp is a live online interviewing platform that allows 2 people interview each other with algorithms and data structures questions. 

I have done more than 10 pramps and have collected below questions: 

1. K-Messed Array Sort 
2. Flatten a Dictionary 
3. Array Index & Element Equality
4. Decode Variations
